### ⭐ About me ⭐

An experienced back-end generalist, specializing in Python.

I created
[Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama),
the world's
[28th most popular](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/#colorama)
Python library,
present at international conferences like PyCon, and am a nominated Fellow of the Python Software
Foundation. I make continual open source contributions, e.g. this recent drive-by
[analysis and fixes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/3671)
for static web site generator Nikola, or
[this page of ModernGL docs](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/buffer_format.html),
which I created from scratch to help me understand a fiddly API concept, using plain
language but without skirting details.\

I consult and mentor in Test-Driven Development (TDD), favoring the "London
School" and "double loop" variants, when appropriate. I was tech reviewer on O'Reilly's
[Test Driven Development with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698),
published on testing
[in Python Magazine](https://www.tartley.com/posts/acceptance-testing-net-applications-using-ironpython),
and landed modest CPython patches [in unitttest](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1341bb0019868345bab8adff94263c81e1d66eae).

I create mentoring relationships and high trust environments, believing in compassion
and integrity. I forge great team spirit and raise morale by building radically jovial
relationships, taking pride in our humane treatment of one another, and in our raised
expectations of what we become capable of as a group. Great teams create great
individuals, not the other way around.
